# ReactResolve

ReactResolve is a lightweight, client-side issue resolution tool designed to help teams and individuals track and search through issues and their resolutions efficiently. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, it offers a fast and responsive user interface, making it easier to manage issues without the need for a backend setup.

This project utilizes modern web technologies to provide an intuitive and powerful search functionality, allowing users to quickly find relevant issues and their associated resolutions. With the use of Fuse.js for search and React Query for potential future state management, ReactResolve stands out as a scalable and flexible solution for issue tracking.

## Features

- **Lightweight Issue Tracking**: Easily upload and manage issues with associated resolutions.
- **Client-Side Search**: Utilize Fuse.js for powerful and efficient search capabilities.
- **Responsive UI**: Thanks to Tailwind CSS, the interface is clean, modern, and fully responsive.
